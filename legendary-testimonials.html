				<h3>Testimonials from our raving fans</h3>
				<p>Hampton Inn and Suites Port Arthur</p>
				<p>The check-in process was one of the most friendly and efficient that I have ever experienced. After a long day of traveling, it was a welcome that was very much needed. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were quiet. Will book this hotel again for any future stays in Port Arthur, TX!</p>

				<p>Holiday Inn Express and Suites West Road</p>
				<p>This is my second visit to this hotel and each time the staff were very friendly and sincere in trying to make my visit as enjoyable as possible. Sheviki was very courteous when checking me in for my stay. Joshua even remembered my name from my first visit which makes you feel extra welcome. The staff embraces the concept of working as a team. The rooms were clean and upscale. Even the bath towels were soft and absorbent. All the little things add up for a very pleasant stay.</p>

				<p>Holiday Inn and Suites NW Austin</p>
				<p>I recently stayed at this Holiday Inn with my father for several days and had an amazing experience with the staff. The site itself was great as well, very clean and well kept – but the best thing going is the staff. We were delayed in town for several days without a rental car and several changes to our schedule and the staff were there to support us the entire way. We utilized the shuttle service multiple times (sometimes multiple times per day) and it was provided promptly and with a smile. Bobbi, the gentleman who escorted us usually was outstanding and one day when he wasn’t available, Paige the Assistant General Manager jumped in the van and came to pick us up herself within minutes of us calling. I can’t say enough for this staff and the home town treatment we received. They scheduled transportation for us, gave great advice/recommendations of the area and were happy to help with anything we needed. As a weekly traveler for work, I know it’s rare to receive this sort of service and I was very impressed. Highly recommended!</p>

				<p>Hampton Inn and Suites Center</p>
				<p>I selected the Hampton Inn at Center, Texas, because of previous hotel stays at other Hampton Inn properties and my visit there was exceptional. The building and rooms were clean and the staff was great. The hotel is located in a part of Center that makes getting around easy and has enough to offer close by for this small Texas town. I would highly recommend anybody traveling around Center to stay at the Hampton Inn over all other area hotels.</p>

				<h3 class="mTop70">Testimonial # 6</h3>
				<p>Hampton Inn Victoria</p>
				<p>The hotel was easy to find, staff was extra nice (treated us better than family)! The room was clean and cleaning service stayed on top of all our needs without us having to ask. The breakfast buffet was great, lots of variety - had something for everyone. The pool was clean and had pool toys for the kids. The fitness center, business office, grilling/picnic area were all fully functional, clean &amp; updated. We recently returned from an upscale resort in Hawaii and I can honestly say Hampton Inn went above &amp; beyond my expectations of a small town hotel. Sincere thanks to the staff!</p>

				<h3 class="mTop70">Testimonial # 7</h3>
				<p>TownePlace Suites Clear Lake</p>
				<p>Great property! Check-in was a breeze, staff was great, and peanut butter cookies to die for. Also loved the spring snapdragons planted: not "Hey, go spend $20 and put some plants in," but a well thought out landscaping with beautiful color. It's not often you want to take pictures of a hotel flower bed! Loved the layout with our rooms in another building from checkout. Rooms were clean, well-maintained, public areas were nice. Especially loved the "Texas" shaped waffle maker! If you have to do business in the Clear Lake/NASA area, I'd strongly recommend this property.</p>
